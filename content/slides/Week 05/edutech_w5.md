### Can you describe what is a *game*?

<!-- some of the features are superficial, some are fundamental-->

---
### Did you think of the following keywords?
- competitive, has rule/goal, like sports game 
- fun, can be a social activity, like family game 
- problem-solving,  you can become better at the game through practice
- engaging, time-absorbing
- ...

###  The big question: Can we implement game-like elements in education, and why?

---
### Concepts
- Gamification: the use of game design elements in non-game contexts
- Gameful learning design: redesigning core elements of a learning environment according to game design principles.

---
### Buzzword or Solution?

---
###  Demystify Gamification
- A gameful learning environment doesn't need to look like a video game.
- Gameful learning is inspired by the game design principles, but more fundamentally, by human psychology.

---
### Let's look at the psychological principles behind the game-based learning ðŸ‘“

---
### Operant Conditioning

- A form of learning (stimulus-response association) 
- Itâ€™s a learning process in which a behavior is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. 

---
#### Types of consequences

- If behavior increases or maintained, then the consequence is a "Reinforcement"
  - Ex: Students are praised for respectfully disagreeing with another classmate; they learn to do this more often in the classroom.

---
- If behavior decreases, then the consequence is a "Punishment"
  - Ex: Students are reprimanded for laughing when a classmate makes a mistake; they donâ€™t like being reprimanded so they stop doing this in the classroom.

---
####  Reinforcements in the game are...
 
- Constant: every small achievement is rewarded explicitly (experience point, budge, equipment)
- Well-Defined: it's clear how to get the rewards
- Varied: visual, auditory, societal...


---
####  Reinforcements in a traditional classroom are often...

- Inconsistent: not all students, all improvements can be acknowledged due to large class size
- Vague: students are confused about their progress
- Singular: score,  teacher's evaluation

---
####  Punishments in the game are...
 
- Minor: lose a game won't cause you real harm
- Reversible: you can always restart a game and it's OK to practice as long as you want
- Transparent: you know why you lose the game

---
####  Punishments in the classroom are...
 
- Major: high-stake exam 
- Permanent: once you fail a class, there's nothing much you can do
- Opaque: you don't know for sure why you fail a class

---
#### Good operant conditioning schedule (like in game) will encourage students to...

- Actively seek challenges
- Not concerned about failure

### Take-home points

- Gameful learning environment â‰  Learning in video games
- It's about using the psychological principles behind good games to motive students 
- We can learn from games about how to reinforce student's learning process
