### Looking back...

---
### Multi-Media Learning
What‚Äôs the unique advantage of each medium?

---
### Embodied Learning with AR/VR
What does immersion in a virtual environment feels like? And why would that experience benefit learning?

---
###  Game-Based Learning
What can we learn from the game designs?

---
###  Personalized and Adaptive Learning with AI
Can artificial intelligence subsititute teacher's responsibility?

---
###  Child Development and Technology
How can we use digital experience to foster not hinder children's development?

---
###  Cloud-Based Learning
How does the traditional teacher-student interaction changed by the internet?

<!-- these are pretty big questions, cannot be answered with an absolute statement, but at least you might have some ideas now how to approach these issues -->

---
###  Last words
- To understand how tools work is the preconditon of good instructional decisons.
<!-- that's why we have intensive demo and surveying many different technologies -->
- Technology maybe new, but what makes instruction effective stays unchanged.
- New technology is a method/tool, not a solution.
<!-- - on the flip side, technology isn't everything, it helps but not determines good instruction -->

<!-- ###  Critism
Essay-scoring engines don‚Äôt actually analyze the quality of writing. They‚Äôre trained on sets of hundreds of example essays to recognize patterns that correlate with higher or lower human-assigned grades.  -->

###  Differentiated Instruction
- Modify instruction in light of student difference
- Acknowledge the individual needs, preference, background of students

---
###  What to differentiate?
- Content: when students start at different places in the curriculum and may proceed at different paces.
- Process: preference of different sensory module
- Product: different assignments and evaluation methods
- Learning environment: ecological factors 

---
###  What does technology do to differentiate?
- Self-directed approach: provides oppurtunity for students to choose freely
- Boolean approach: based on existing decision tree (e.g., age group)
- Model-based approach: AI and big data 

---
###  Example 1: self-directed + decision tree
