###  What if students use AI for writing?
- AI is capable of gathtering and reorganizing information in a logical and creative way, similar to what a writing assignment is designed for
<!-- - unlike calculator and google search, AI is not just yet another tool that relieves you from tedious work -->
- AI creates text that's logical and natural without "caring" about right or wrong

<!-- imagine you were assignement to write a paper about the significance of ww2, for you who hasn't touched this topic before, this is theoretically new, but in terms of the world generally it's simply a regurgitation of what has been written a million times before.  -->
