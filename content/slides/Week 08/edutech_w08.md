###  Have you experienced these in your everyday life?
- YouTube suggests new videos based on what you have watched
- Your smart phone can automatically create an album with photos with your face in it
- You have to prove "I'm not a robot" during login
- These are possible because of “artificial intelligence” (AI)

###  What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
- AI are intelligent computer programs that mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind 
- All the current AI applications are narrow and weak: 
    - solves a specific kind of problem: e.g., autonomous car, ad optimization, chatbot
    - only acting intelligently in a few areas (pattern recognition and generation), not "thinking" intelligently (self-conscious mind)
<!-- - Traditional computer program: Input → Output is predetermined -->
<!-- - AI: Input → Output is conditional -->
    <!-- - training data → algorithm → real data -->

---
###  Key features of AI
- Autonomy: The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user.
- Adaptivity: The ability to improve performance by learning from experience.

---
###  Why is it "intelligent"?
- Learning is the acquisition of associations: what input leads to what output 
- AI can make inferences about new inputs based on learned associations
- Therefore AI is capable of "learning" based on "past experience", similar to human decision making

### What is ML?
- Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI, which deals with building systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data.

---
### Two types of ML
- supervised learning: use labeled data as examples to achieve classification and prediction, e.g., identify fake Twitter bots, recognize handwritten numbers 
- unsupervised learning: use unlabeled data to reveal hidden structures and generate output similar to input, e.g., write in the tone of Shakespeare, generate image based on text prompt
