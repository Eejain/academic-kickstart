###  Have you experienced these in your everyday life?
- YouTube suggests new videos based on what you have watched
- Your smart phone can automatically create an album with photos with your face in it
- You have to prove "I'm not a robot" during login
- These are possible because of “artificial intelligence” (AI)

###  What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
- AI are intelligent computer programs that mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind 
- Traditional computer program: Input → Output is predetermined
- AI: Input → Output is conditional
    - training data → algorithm → real data

---
###  Key features of AI
- Autonomy: The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user.
- Adaptivity: The ability to improve performance by learning from experience.

---
###  Why is it "intelligent"?
- Learning is the acquisition of associations: what input leads to what output 
- AI can make inferences about new inputs based on learned associations
- Therefore AI is capable of "learning" based on "past experience", similar to human decision making
