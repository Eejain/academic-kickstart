###  Have you experienced these in your daily life?
- YouTube suggests new videos based on what you have watched
- Your iPhone labels every photo with your face in it
- You have to prove "I'm not a robot" during login
- These are possible because of “artificial intelligence” (AI)

###  What is artificial intellilgence (AI)?
- "AI are cool things that computer programs can't do."
- Traditional computer program: Input → Output is predetermined
- AI: Input → Output is conditional
    - training data → algorithm → real data

---
###  Key features of AI
- Autonomy: The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user.
- Adaptivity: The ability to improve performance by learning from experience.

---
###  Why is it intelligent?
- Learning is the acquisition of associations: what input leads to what output 
- AI can make inferences about new inputs based on learned associations
- Therefore AI is capable of "learning" based on "past experience", similar to human decision making

###  Mini Quiz: Are they AI?
- Spreadsheet that calculates sums and other pre-defined functions on given data
- Predicting the stock market by fitting a curve to past data about stock prices
- A GPS navigation system for finding the fastest route
- A music recommendation system such as Spotify that suggests music based on the users' listening behavior
- Big data storage solutions that can store huge amounts of data (such as images or video) and stream them to many users at the same time
- Photo editing features such as brightness and contrast in applications such as Photoshop
- Style transfer filters in applications such as Prisma that take a photo and transform it into different art styles (impressionist, cubist, ...)

###  Critism
Essay-scoring engines don’t actually analyze the quality of writing. They’re trained on sets of hundreds of example essays to recognize patterns that correlate with higher or lower human-assigned grades.
