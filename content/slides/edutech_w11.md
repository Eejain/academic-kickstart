###  How to teach with both words and images?
- Words can be printed (paper or screen) or spoken
- Images can be static (illustrations, graphs, charts, photos, or maps) or dynamic (animation, video, or interactive illustrations)

---
- Combining words and images: e.g., narrated animation that explains how a causal system works 
    -  how a car’s braking system works, how the human respiratory system works, how lightning storms develop, how plants grow…

---
###  Why students found meaningful learning difficult?
- Meaningful learning: deep understanding of the material, not only being able to retain the knowledge but also transfer to new situations
- Meaningful learning requires the student engage in substantial cognitive processing during learning
- But people's capacity for cognitive processing is severely limited


---
###  Limitation in cognitive capacity: evidence 
- Determine whether the calculation is correct or not: say out loud, “yes” or
“no.” 
- Then look at the word that follows the formula and try to memorize it
- Each slide will only be shown for 5 seconds

Now write down the words in order 

---
###  Correct answer
- BOOK, HOUSE, JACKET, CAT, PEN, WATER
- How many words did you get?
- The average is around 3

---
###  The danger of cognitive overload 
- Learning is difficult, yet cognitive resource is limited
- When the task demands exceeds the capacity of cognitive resource, cognitive overload happens
- Leads to failure in retention and transfer, and long-term stress

---
### How to avoid cognitive overload in student's learning?
- Minimize extraneous cognitive load: cognitive processing that does not contribute to meaningful learning. 
- It is caused by presenting the material in a poorly designed layout or including non-essential material in a lesson.

---
###  Coherence principle
- Remove unessential elements from instructional material
    + 2 minutes of animated narration introducing ocean waves
    + the narration plus video clips showing sensational tsunami storms
    + the narration plus formulas and numerical computations
+ Which one do you choose? 

---
###  Redundancy principle
- Avoid redundant information from different input channels
    + narration video
    + narration plus caption that mirror the narration
+ Which one do you choose?

---
###  Signaling principle
- Add cues that direct the learner’s attention to the essential information
    - narration video
    - narration video with headings for each section
    - narration with intonation emphasis on linking words, such as "because of this"
- Which one do you choose? 

---
###  Temporal/spatial contiguity principle
- When both verbal explanation and graphic representation are necessary for learning, present both simultaneously 
    + narrated animation
    + narration then animation without sound
    + written text and figure on the same page
    + written text and figure on different pages
+ Which one do you choose?
