#### ⏱ Workflow: instructor's perspective
- Participate and moderate on-line discussions
- Prepare course content in simple text file
    - Text file is automatically updated and compiled to presentation slides: reveal.js
    - All the updates are instantly visible on the website to everyone: Hugo + Git
- Lecture and moderate discussions

<aside class="notes">
      git benefits: transparent change log (what has been changed and why),automatically synced between all participants' devices, automatically reflects on the course website, eventually evrything is always up to date all the time for all parties.
