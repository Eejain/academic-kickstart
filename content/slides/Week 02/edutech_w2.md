### What is ICT?
- More than IT (informational technology)
- Information and communications technology (ICT)

---
### The dilemma of modern educators
- Too many ICT tools that come out too fast
- Yet we have little guidance when making choices 
- Will _der Wegweiser_ leads us to a wise path?

<!-- we could not find anything that "simply works" when we need them the most -->
<!-- and finding a way when you are in a hurry is not a good idea  -->

---
### Search for a solution in a hurry?

<!-- hoping for a sighpost when we needed it the most is not a good solution for solving problems, instead we should prepare a toolbox beforehand  -->
---
### Prepare a toolbox beforehand!
- All tools have learning curves, do your preparation early

---
### Our goal for preparing the toolbox

<!-- generic tools that suits many cases and scenarios, knowing how to fish -->

---
### Selecting a tool: Backward design
- Like always, plan your instructional goals first
- Then think backwards: what kind of tools would you need to fulfill your instructional objective?
    - I want students to be able to...
    - This tool should help students to...
    - Adjectives describing this tool

<!-- general strategy -->

---
### Example of using backward design
- I want students to be able to memorize molecule structure  
- This tool should help them to reconstruct key elements in the structure
- Therefore, it should have the following feature:
    - interactive 3D modeling (to reconstruct)
    - easy to use (for students)
- Search for "easy interactive 3D modeling software/app"
- Viola, Google gives you many candidates

<!-- next step: evaluate these tools to see whether they are really fitting  -->

---
### Evaluating a tool: SAMR model
- Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition
- Four types of reasons to use new ICT tools over old ones
- A framework to consider: Do you really need the new tool?

---
### Example of using SAMR
- Use SAMR to make a sentence 
- I *substitute* the paper-based flashcards with [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) to teach German, because...  
    - it *augments* the existing function of flashcards by linking an image or video to the card;
    - it *modifies* the function of flashcards by adding possibility of setting deadline for learning the cards and compare with class mates 
    - it *redefines* flashcards because users can make cards together with anyone in the world.

---
### Create our own ICT toolbox
- Content tools: facilitate delivering certain content. Khan Academy, Google Arts & Culture
- Assessment tools: evaluate what students know. Kahoot, Google Forms
- Community tools: enable group and collaborative work. Hypotes.is, Diigo, Notion
- Creative tools: allow students to create their own work. Canva, Adobe Spark 

---
### Workflow
- Everyone will [pick one category of ICT tools ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Yyvj4CGUOinyswBB7jx9eqXbUTb-1Rg35n99tZoVhI/edit?usp=sharing) they are most interested in using. 
- You will work together with other classmates who&rsquo;s also interested in this category of tools.
- During the semester, you will collaboratively gather and evaluate the ICT tools according to SAMR model.
- At the end of the semester, you will present your selection and evaluation of ICT tools as a group.
- The presentation can take a variety of formats, including (a) regular slides presentation; (b)hands-on workshop; (c) simulation of real lesson; or any otherformats you find appropriate.
