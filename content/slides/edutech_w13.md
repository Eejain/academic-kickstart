### *Education on the Horizon: Teaching and Learning with Technology*
## Week 11: Cloud-based Learning  Pt. 2
===
#### Dr. Yizhen (Eejain) Huang
###### Department Erziehungswissenschaft, University of Potsdam


---
###  Quick recap
- Terminology: webinar, xMOOC, cMOOC
- On-line platform for systematic instructions, suitable for flipped-classroom

---
### Relevance for Teacher Education 
- [Teach-Now](https://teach-now.edu/): getting a teaching certificate through online training
- What do you think of this certification program? 

---
###  Pros and cons of cloud-based instruction

> I studied at the Fernuniversität Hagen. It’s a university  more or less completely based on cloud based learning....I love, that i am very flexible in how i study and when i study. I also enjoy that i can study and read for myself. ...But i really miss talking about the subjects with other students. 

- What were your general impressions about online learning in the teacher education program in the past year ? 

---
###  What makes an effective seminar also makes a great webinar
- have "coffee break" for social talk
- every participant work together to achieve a shared goal (with Google Doc or other cloud-based tools)
- have variety of activities 
- check in and wrap up
- what do you think it's important for an engaging online seminar? 

---
###  Cloud-based but without videos 
- requires less technology, but still engaging 
- useful also for leaners who prefer textual, asynchronous discussion 

---
### Example 1
Have you taking margin notes on your books before?

---
###  Why do you annotate?
- highlight important points
- comment your own ideas
- raise questions
- ...
- but not for social communication, right? 

---
###  Cloud-based annotation
- [Collaborative and social annotation](https://web.hypothes.is/education/)
- teacher can post questions directly along the text
- students can discuss with each other instantly while they read
- works for other medium too
- facilitate knowledge comprehension, tansmission, communication and even creation

<!-- ### Looking back... -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ### Multi-Media Learning -->
<!-- What’s the unique advantage of each medium? -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ###  Game-Based Learning -->
<!-- What can we learn from the game designs? -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ### Embodied Learning with AR/VR -->
<!-- What does immersion in a virtual environment feels like? And why would that experience benefit learning? -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ###  Personalized and Adaptive Learning with AI -->
<!-- Can artificial intelligence subsititute teacher's responsibility?  -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ###  Child Development and Technology -->
<!-- How can we use digital experience to foster not hinder children's development? -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ###  Cloud-Based Learning -->
<!-- How does the traditional teacher-student interaction changed by the internet?  -->

<!-- <\!-- these are pretty big questions, cannot be answered with an absolute statement, but at least you might have some ideas now how to approach these issues -\->  -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ###  Last words -->
<!-- - To understand how tools work is the preconditon of good instructional decisons.  -->
<!-- <\!-- that's why we have intensive demo and surveying many different technologies -\-> -->
<!-- - Technology maybe new, but what makes instruction effective stays unchanged.  -->
<!-- - New technology is a method/tool, not a solution. -->
<!-- <\!-- - on the flip side, technology isn't everything, it helps but not determines good instruction -\-> -->
