###  Pros and cons

> I studied at the Fernuniversit√§t Hagen. It‚Äôs a university  more or less completely based on cloud based learning....I love, that i am very flexible in how i study and when i study. I also enjoy that i can study and read for myself. ...But i really miss talking about the subjects with other students.

What can we learn from the game designs?

---
### Embodied Learning with AR/VR
What does immersion in a virtual environment feels like? And why would that experience benefit learning?

---
###  Personalized and Adaptive Learning with AI
Can artificial intelligence subsititute teacher's responsibility? 

---
###  Child Development and Technology
How can we use digital experience to foster not hinder children's development?

---
###  Cloud-Based Learning
How does the traditional teacher-student interaction changed by the internet? 

<!-- these are pretty big questions, cannot be answered with an absolute statement, but at least you might have some ideas now how to approach these issues --> 

---
###  Last words
- To understand how tools work is the preconditon of good instructional decisons. 
<!-- that's why we have intensive demo and surveying many different technologies -->
- Technology maybe new, but what makes instruction effective stays unchanged. 
- New technology is a method/tool, not a solution.
<!-- - on the flip side, technology isn't everything, it helps but not determines good instruction -->
