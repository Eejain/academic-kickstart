### Are we addicted to the screen?

###  Why do we care more about children's digital usage?

---
###  Children have diffulty in delaying gratification
- [The marshmallow test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX_oy9614HQ)
- The ability to resist instant gratification is highly correlated with future achievement 

---
###  Negative impacts
- Screen addiction
- Online bullying
- ADHD
- Depression
- ...

---
###  A word of caution
- All the medium had been criticized at some point
- Even the [books](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/reading-bad-your-health)!
- Medium itself doesn't carry value judgment, but content does 

---
###  How to choose proper educational content?

---
### Children's cognitive development
- Children's *thinking* is fundamentally *different* from adult's
- Educational content has to match the children's cognitive development stage (not necessarily their ages) and promote "metacognition"
---
###  Piaget's theory
- Development is characterized by a sequence of *stages*
- Each stage builds on preceding stages, but is qualitatively unique
- Children need to accomplish the essential task of one stage in order to enter the next

### Sensorimotor stage: Object permanence

- The task of sensorimotor stage is understanding object's presence is absolute

---
### Pre-operational stage: Theory of mind

- The task of pre-operational stage is understanding other people also have their own thinking
- Can you solve the question on the left?

---
### Three mountain experiment

- Another classic test to check if children can understand theory of mind
- The child has to answer what kind of view the doll is looking at

### Concrete operational stage: Conservation problem

- Can you tell me which container in picture c has more liquid?
- At the end of concrete operational stage, children should be able to solve this conservation problem

---
### Formal operational stage: Abstract reasoning

- In the last stage of cognitive development, children need to understand abstarct concept

### Let's test your knowledge

Patricia is upset because she is convinced that her brother has a bigger piece of cake than she does. Her dad quickly slices Patricia's piece of cake in two and tells her that she now has "more" cake. If Patricia calms down and is convinced that she does have more cake than her brother, it would suggest that she:

A.  has not yet mastered object permanence.

B.  does not understand the process of assimilation.

C.  does not yet understand conservation.

D.  is displaying egocentric reasoning.

And at what stage she will be acquiring that ability?

A Fairy-Tale-King invites you to sit down in front of him… 
“design for me, a magical castle with beautiful towers.” It turns out that he has enough money to pay for ten floors and tells you to distribute these ten floors any way you like between your towers. 

“However”, he whispers, “None of the towers can be the same height!” For example, you could build three towers of height 4,5,1 but you could not build four towers of heights 1,3,5,1 because two towers are of height 1.

<!-- ^ this is a problem for first grader with 24 potential solutions, we could script several student avatars answer the question to increase interactivity -->

## When you are thinking about this problem, did you also thought about the *thinking* itself?

---
## Think about thinking = Metacognition

- Metacognition means “thinking about one’s own thinking”, “higher-order cognition about cognition”, “knowledge about knowledge”, “thoughts about thoughts” or “reflection about reflection”
- Monitor and organize your own thinking is important for effective problem solving! 

---
## How to solve ANY problem? 

![](/media/metacog_cycle.png)

---
## For example...
- Assess the task: Have I see similar problem before? How difficult this might be?
- Evaluate strengths/weaknesses: Can I ask someone for help regarding xxx? 
- Plan the approach: What's my goal? How can I get there?
- Apply strategies: Am I on the right track?
- Reflect: Did I meet my goal? Are there different ways to do it?

### Take home message
- Media is not evil for kid's development 
- Children's learning needs to be scaffolded with consideration to 
    - their cognitive development stage
    - their metacognition strategy
