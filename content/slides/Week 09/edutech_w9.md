##  Work with or against generative AI?

---
###  AI is my foe
- Cut Internet access during exam and assignment
- Completely handwritten work 

---
###  AI is my friend

---
###  Method 1: Co-pilot
- Student is the commander, AI is the co-pilot
- The work to be evaluated is the iterative "commands" to AI (prompt history)

---
###  Method 2: Zero trust homework
- AI's answer should be assumed to be wrong or misleading
- Student's learn to be a verifier and an editor
- The work to be evaluated is the "corrections" of AI writing

---
###  Method 3: Power user
- Students tweaks the default AI setting to generate different and creative responses
- The work to be evaluated is the "creativity" of AI responses
