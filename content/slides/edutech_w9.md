###  Differentiated Instruction
- Modify instruction in light of student difference (Tomlinson, 1999)
- Acknowledge the individual needs, preference, background of students

---
###  What to differentiate?
- Content: when students start at different places in the curriculum and may proceed at different paces.
- Process: preference of different sensory module
- Product: different assignments and evaluation methods
- Learning environment: ecological factors 

---
###  What does technology do to differentiate?
- Self-directed approach: provides oppurtunity for students to choose freely
- Boolean approach: based on existing decision tree (e.g., age group)
- Model-based approach: AI and big data

###  Example 1: self-directed + decision tree
