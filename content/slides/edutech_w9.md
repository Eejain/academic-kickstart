###  Mini Quiz: Are they AI?
- Spreadsheet that calculates sums and other pre-defined functions on given data
- Predicting the stock market by fitting a curve to past data about stock prices
- A GPS navigation system for finding the fastest route
- A music recommendation system such as Spotify that suggests music based on the users' listening behavior
- Big data storage solutions that can store huge amounts of data (such as images or video) and stream them to many users at the same time
- Photo editing features such as brightness and contrast in applications such as Photoshop
- Style transfer filters in applications such as Prisma that take a photo and transform it into different art styles (impressionist, cubist, ...)

###  Critism

###  Differentiated Instruction
- Modify instruction in light of student difference
- Acknowledge the individual needs, preference, background of students

---
###  What to differentiate?
- Content: when students start at different places in the curriculum and may proceed at different paces.
- Process: preference of different sensory module
- Product: different assignments and evaluation methods
- Learning environment: ecological factors 

---
###  What does technology do to differentiate?
- Self-directed approach: provides oppurtunity for students to choose freely
- Boolean approach: based on existing decision tree (e.g., age group)
- Model-based approach: AI and big data 

---
###  Example 1: self-directed + decision tree
