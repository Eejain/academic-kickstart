### Recap
- Multimedia learning: present the material using various media types that are intended to foster learning.
      - Media types can include text, audio, static graphic (photos, drawings, maps, charts, figures), dynamic graphic (video, animation), or any other vehicles of information (we experience the world through different senses)

---
### Thank you for the active discussion in Discord! Let's address some of the questions üòÅ

---
> It wasn't clear to me before that reading a text on an iPad...is not multi media learning 

> -- Luisa

---
### Difference between "environment" and "medium"

- The tablet is an learning *environment*
- You can either present single- or multi-*media* content in this environment
      + a "book behind glass" or a "interactive, media-rich" environment

---
### Learning style theory: pros and cons
- Claims of the learning style theory:
      + Each person has a preferred way of receiving new information: visual, auditory, kinesthetic (True)
      + When learning something new, student will learn better when the instruction matches their preferred media types (False)

---
- Students do have preferences, but that don't translate directly to performance, because their knowledge/skill is often not tested directly from these sensory modalities
      + e.g., Students learn about additon by hearing a song vs. students learn about harmonious patteren by hearing a song, which makes more sense?

---
> I still don't really understand why the teacher's voice is not a medium. I don't see a big difference between a voice and an audio recording. 

> -- Jenny/ErikM

### xx learning ‚â† learning through xx

- Auditory learning and learning through audio is different, same for visual leanring and learning through visual
      - Whether you are really trying to teach (and test) some information from this particular sensory modality, or simply use it as a vehicle.

---
> In PE lessons it might be more difficult (to use audio/visual), because to me movement is always something you have to experience in order to learn and improve it. 

> -- Luisa

---
### Implentation of multi-media for different subjects

- For acquiring procedural-motor knowledge, dynamic imagery is actually quite powerful (learning by watching)
- But need to consider different visual perspectives
      + external vs. internal perspective
      + external perspective: learn about how to position different body parts
      + internal perspective: learn about how to position body in relation to the environment

---
### Examples about visual perspectives
- External is bettern internal imagery: [gymnastics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JueHTIusqzI)
- Internal is better than external imagery: [slalom](http://www.effectiveskiing.com/Topic/Visualization)

### How to design a course with multi-media elements? 
> I wonder, how do I decide which medium will be the most fitting one, for the topic as well as for my students?
> -- Leonie

---
### There's not a definite answer, but let's look at some rule of thumbs...üëç

---
### 1. The multi-media element needs to have reprentational, not decorational, purpose 
- Decorational: the primary instructional function of the element is to intrigue/motivate the learner
- Representational: the topic to be learned is explicitly depicted in the multi-media element
- Read more: H√∂ffler, T. N., & Leutner, D. (2007). Instructional animation versus static pictures: A meta-analysis. *Learning and Instruction, 17*, 722‚Äì738.

---
### 2. Inclusion of multiple sensory modalities are usually helpful, given that they are meaninfully associated
- Storage of information is like a web 
- More associations = better remembering
- Read more: Sch√ºler, A., Scheiter, K., & van Genuchten, E. (2011). The Role of Working Memory in Multimedia Instruction: Is Working Memory Working During Learning from Text and Pictures? *Educational Psychology Review, 23*, 389‚Äì411.


---
### 3. Think about what you really want to teach first, and then, how to present them

- For example, when using visuals to teach language, do you really want to teach the visual details?
      - Example of using visuals to teach English alphabet versus Chinese characters, which is more appropriate?


---
## Some hands-on examples 
- Let's analyze together:
      - What kind of multi-meida elements are included?
      - Have they been used properly or not?
