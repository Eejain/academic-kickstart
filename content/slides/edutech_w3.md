### *Education on the Horizon: Teaching and Learning with Technology*
## Week 3: Multimedia Learning

### What is media?
- Media (singular: medium) are tools used to store and deliver information or data
- Multimedia are communications that incorporate multiple forms of information content and processing

![](/media/media.jpg)

---
### Medium is like the *vehicle* of information. 

---
### You can convey similar content with different media
![](/media/different-transportation.png)

---
### What is multimedia learning
- Present the material using various media types that are intended to foster learning.
- Types of media: text, audio, static graphic (photos, drawings, maps, charts, figures), dynamic graphic (video, animation), or any other vehicle of information

<!-- ---
### Why is it an attractive idea?

- Suitability: sometimes one media is more suitable to present certain information than others
- Student preference: sometimes one prefer certain media than others

---
### Let's consider suitability first... -->

---
### How to design a course with multimedia elements? 
> I wonder, how do I decide which medium will be the most fitting one, for the topic as well as for my students?

---
### Sometimes visuals are better than words? 

---
### Example 1. How would you explain how a *smart phone* works?

---

---
### Example 2. How do you decide what to wear?

---
### Visual over words
- When the concept is abstract and hard to visualize in the mind.
- When the logic is not linear.
- [example in presentation slides design](https://prezi.com/p/7upyb8nulbzs/ux-design-tips-for-product-managers/?click_source=logged_element&element_type=prezi_card&element_text=7upyb8nulbzs)

<!-- ---
### Audio over visual?
- Audio carries unique information
      + Example: [Hearning range test (6:25-10:00)](https://www.20k.org/episodes/hearingloss ) -->

<!-- ---
### What about personal preferences for media types?

---
### Is the "learning style" theory true?
- Claims of the learning style theory:
      + Each person has a preferred way of receiving new information: visual, auditory, kinesthetic
      + When learning something new, student will learn better when the instruction matches their preferred media types
+ Are these claims true?

---
### Example of instruction according to learning style theory
- When learning addition...
      - Visual learner: view grouping of objects
      - Auditory learner: listen to sets of rhythms
      - Kinesthetic learner: arrange objects into groups

---
### What's wrong with this approach?
- No matter what's the input module, most of the information are encoded semantically (as meaning)
- Everyone can benefit from various representations of the same content
 -->
<!-- ---
### Recap
- Multimedia learning: present the material using various media types that are intended to foster learning.
      - Media types can include text, audio, static graphic (photos, drawings, maps, charts, figures), dynamic graphic (video, animation), or any other vehicles of information (we experience the world through different senses)

### Thank you for the active discussion in Discord! Let's address some of the questions üòÅ

---
> It wasn't clear to me before that reading a text on an iPad...is not multi media learning 

> -- Luisa

---
### Difference between "environment" and "medium"

- The tablet is an learning *environment*
- You can either present single- or multi-*media* content in this environment
      + a "book behind glass" or a "interactive, media-rich" environment

---
### Learning style theory: pros and cons
- Claims of the learning style theory:
      + Each person has a preferred way of receiving new information: visual, auditory, kinesthetic (True)
      + When learning something new, student will learn better when the instruction matches their preferred media types (False)

---
- Students do have preferences, but that don't translate directly to performance, because their knowledge/skill is often not tested directly from these sensory modalities
      + e.g., Students learn about additon by hearing a song vs. students learn about harmonious patteren by hearing a song, which makes more sense?

---
> I still don't really understand why the teacher's voice is not a medium. I don't see a big difference between a voice and an audio recording. 

> -- Jenny/ErikM

### xx learning ‚â† learning through xx

- Auditory learning and learning through audio is different, same for visual leanring and learning through visual
      - Whether you are really trying to teach (and test) some information from this particular sensory modality, or simply use it as a vehicle.

---
> In PE lessons it might be more difficult (to use audio/visual), because to me movement is always something you have to experience in order to learn and improve it. 

> -- Luisa -->

---
### But are visuals also relevant for PE?

- For acquiring procedural-motor knowledge, dynamic imagery is actually quite powerful (learning by watching)
- But need to consider different visual perspectives

---
### Examples about visual perspectives
- External is bettern internal imagery when learning about how to position different body parts: [Gymnastics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JueHTIusqzI)
- Internal is better than external imagery when learning about how to position body in relation to the environment: [Skiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4tsX20dPX0)

### General rule of thumbs...üëç

---
#### The multimedia element needs to have reprentational, not decorational, purpose [^1]
- Decorational: the primary instructional function of the element is to intrigue/motivate the learner
- Representational: the topic to be learned is explicitly depicted in the multi-media element

[^1]: H√∂ffler, T. N., & Leutner, D. (2007). Instructional animation versus static pictures: A meta-analysis. *Learning and Instruction, 17*, 722‚Äì738.

###  Example: Bad Clipart

---
#### Inclusion of multiple sensory modalities are usually helpful, given that they are meaninfully associated [^1]
- Storage of information is like a web 
- More associations = better remembering

---
### Example
- When using visuals to teach language, do you really want to teach the visual details?
- Using visuals to teach English alphabet? 
- What about Chinese characters?

###  Coherence principle
- Remove unessential elements from instructional material

---
### Example: Which one do you choose? 
- 2 minutes of animated narration introducing ocean waves
- the narration plus video clips showing sensational tsunami storms
- the narration plus formulas and numerical computations


---
###  Temporal/spatial contiguity principle
- When both verbal explanation and graphic representation are necessary for learning, present both simultaneously 

---
###  Example: Which one do you choose? 
- written text and figure on the same page
- written text and figure on different pages

## Some hands-on examples 
- Let's analyze together:
      - What kind of multimeida elements are included?
      - Have they been used properly or not?
