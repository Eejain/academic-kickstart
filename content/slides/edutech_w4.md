## Can you describe what is a *game*?

<!-- some of the features are superficial, some are fundamental-->

---
Your thoughts on game: competitive, rule/goal, fun, group/individual activity, problem-solving,  become better at the game, win/lose, different types 

---
###  Can we implement gameful elements in education, and why?

---
## Concepts
- Gamification: the use of game design elements in non-game contexts
- Gameful learning design: redesigning core elements of a learning environment according to game design principles.

---
### Buzzword or Solution?

---
###  Demystify Gamification
- A gameful learning environment doesn't need to look like a video game.
- Gameful learning is inspired by the game design principles, but more fundamentally, by human psychology.

---
### Let's look at the psychological principles behind the game-based learning ðŸ‘“

---
### Operant Conditioning

- A form of learning (stimulus-response association) 
- Occurs when a behavior is followed and influenced by certain *consequences*
- Itâ€™s a learning process in which a behavior is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. 

---
#### Types of consequences

- If behavior increases or maintained, then the consequence is a "Reinforcement"
  - Ex: Students are praised for respectfully disagreeing with another classmate; they learn to do this more often in the classroom.
- If behavior decreases, then the consequence is a "Punishment"
  - Ex: Students are reprimanded for laughing when a classmate makes a mistake; they donâ€™t like being reprimanded so they stop doing this in the classroom.


---
####  Reinforcements in the game are...
 
- Constant: every small achievement is rewarded explicitly (experience point, budge, equipment)
- Well-Defined: it's clear how to get the rewards
- Varied: visual, auditory, societal...


---
####  Reinforcements in a traditional classroom are often...

- Inconsistent: not all students, all improvements can be acknowledged
- Vague: students are confused about their progress
- Singular: score

---
####  Punishments in the game are...
 
- Minor: lose a game won't cause you real harm
- Reversible: you can always restart a game and it's OK to practice as long as you want
- Transparent: you know why you lose the game

---
####  Punishments in the classroom are...
 
- Major: high-stake exam 
- Permanent: once you fail a class, there's nothing much you can do
- Opaque: you don't know for sure why you fail a class

---
#### Good operant conditioning schedule (like in game) will encourage students to...

- Actively seek challenges
- Not concerned about failure
- Learning for own *growth*, not for *avoiding failure*: [growth mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve/up-next?language=en)


---
###  Why do you want to play a game, not to a class?

---
### Motivation, the force that drives us

- Behavior is motivated by internal (intrinsic) or external (extrinsic) incentives 
    - Extrinsic â€“ attention, praise, grades, rewards, money etc.
    - Intrinsic â€“ feeling of satisfaction, competence, growth, progress etc.
        - [Dan Pink's Talk on Motivation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)

---
####  Why do you want to play a game, not to a class?

- Autonomy: it's your own choice to play a game
- Mastery: you know for sure you can become better at playing the game
- Meaning: ?

---
### Take-home points

- Gameful learning environment â‰  Learning in video games
- It's about using the psychological principles behind good games to motive students 
- We can learn from games about how to reinforce/punish student's learning process
