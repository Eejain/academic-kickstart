### *Education on the Horizon: Teaching and Learning with Technology*
## Week 5: Game-Based Learning Pt. 2
===
#### Dr. Yizhen (Eejain) Huang
###### Department Erziehungswissenschaft, University of Potsdam

----
### Recap
- Game is a structured form of play, usually for enjoyment.
- Gameful learning redesigns core elements of a learning environment according to game design principles.
- These principles are fundamentally psychological.

---
### Your thoughts from last week
- "Praising every achievement maybe manipulative"
- Borrowing game elements mindlessly won't magically motivate students
    - But it's important to understand why good game are so motivating and what we can learn from them
    - A good game-based learning environment can motivate student intrinsically 

---
### Motivation, the force that drives us
- Behavior is motivated by internal (intrinsic) or external (extrinsic) incentives 
    - Extrinsic – attention, praise, grades, rewards, money etc. 
        + powerful only in short term
    - Intrinsic – feeling of satisfaction, competence, growth, progress etc.
        + lasting effect

### How to promote intrinsic motivation?
- Self-determination theory: three conditions for supporting intrinsic motivation
- Autonomy, competence (mastery) and belonging (meaning)
- These three factors can explain why games are intrinsically motivating, and what kind of learning environment we are after. 

<!-- let's more formally define what dan pink has described in the video, self-determination theory talks about three conditions that need to be taken care of -->

---
###  Autonomy
- In game: usually we choose what game we want to play
- Ideal learning environment: the learner seeing himself or herself as the primary locus of control'

---
###  Autonomy: example
- Explore in safe environment enables sense of autonomy
- Games enabling players to take risks by reducing the negative consequences associated with failure. 
    - giving a player infinite lives, freedom to explore the game safe in the knowledge that mistakes will not result in permanent failure. 

---
###  Autonomy: example
- In a gameful course, this same feeling can be established
    - allowing students to redo assignments multiple times to achieve mastery
    - providing alternate assignments that mitigate the impact of failed attempts. 

---
###  Competence (Mastery)
- In game: you know for sure you can become better at playing the game (progress/current status is clear)
- Ideal learning environment: learners engage with course contents because they feel that they can do so successfully

<!-- They are not designed to manipulate students to fish for prizes, but to show clearly what’s the progress, and what to do next -->

---
###  Belonging (Meaning)
- In game: grow together with the community
- Ideal learning environment: learners feel connected to their teachers and peers

###  Gameful learning environment: example
- [GradeCraft](https://www.gradecraft.com/)
    - [A short intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxb3wVwmYyc)
    - 0 up instead of 100 down
    - visualize progress 
    - alternative assessment pathways 
    - create own learning plan
    - adaptive content 
    - can you pinpoint the SDT elements?
