## <span class="section-num">3</span> Course Objectives {#course-objectives}

What does the future of education entail? Does traditional pedagogy still hold true when instructional technology evolves at a rate greater than ever before? This course is intended to map the present landscape of information and communications technology (ICT) used for education, to reflect on their benefits as well as potential drawbacks, and to connect new technology with old ideas.

Specifically, we will examine traditional learning theories from new perspectives, explore best practices for using various technologies for teaching, and apply what we have learned in your specific subject settings. We will cover topics including multi-media learning, game-based learning, embodied learning (VR/AR/XR), personalized and adaptive learning, child development and technology, and cloud-based learning.


## <span class="section-num">4</span> Competence Goal and Evaluation {#competence-goal-and-evaluation}

I hope by the end of this seminar, you would be able to: a) have a good overview of what digital tools are available for educators in the market; b) be able to evaluate and select digital tools for your subjects; c) explore how to keep up with the ever-changing field of information and communications technology.

The evaluation of such goals will be based on your performance in weekly reflection and showcasing ICT tools. There will be no quizzes or tests. Please see below for a detailed description of each task.

-   **Weekly Reflection (20 points)**
    -   Everyone will submit a short response in our shared OneNote (<https://bit.ly/3Op3gm4>) after each meeting.
    -   In the response, please write down in bullet points: what you have learned; what you don't quite understand; what you would like to learn more about regarding the particular topic of the week?

-   **VR Experience (20 points)**
    -   We are going to meet in mid-May in Golm for a VR teaching experience.
    -   More information will be provided later.

-   **ICT Toolbox Showcase (60 points)**
    -   Everyone will pick one category of ICT tools they are most interested in using (<https://bit.ly/3Eri66N>). You will work together with other classmates who's also interested in this category of tools.
    -   During the semester, you will collaboratively gather and evaluate the ICT tools according to a standardized framework.
    -   At the end of the semester, you will present your selection and evaluation of ICT tools as a group. The presentation can take a variety of formats, including (a) regular slides presentation; (b)hands-on workshop; (c) simulation of real lesson; or any otherformats you find appropriate.
    -   We'll introduce this task further on the second week.

-   **Bonus: Annotate the Course Website (no points, but more fun)**
    -   As you will find all the materials in our course website, I also encourage you to use online annotation tool [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) to share your thoughts about our course slides and other contents directly on the webpage.


## <span class="section-num">5</span> Class Policies {#class-policies}

It will be important to follow a few general guidelines to ensure that our lessons run smoothly and are enjoyable for everyone.

-   Class will officially starts 15 minutes after the meeting time- There will be no class break so we can end class earlier.
-   This course is provided in English since I can't speak German (yet). I also encourage you using English within group activities so that I can better facilitate your learning process. But don't struggle with language if you feel more comfortable using German to communicate with your peers.
-   When engaging in discussions please be respectful and relevant. Being respectful includes addressing ideas offered by classmates in a constructive manner. Being relevant requires that comments made in class relate to the material in a way that enriches our learning. Everyone should and will have the chance to contribute to discussions.
