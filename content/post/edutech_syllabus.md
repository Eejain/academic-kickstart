- **Leading Group Discussion (50 points)** : 
    - We'll cover an education related topic each week accompanied by one reading material. The student who's interested in the particular topic will be responsible of leading the discussion, while all the other students are also expected to read the material before class. 
    - For the discussion leader, you will prepare a 10-minute presentation about the topic and lead class discussion, which will comprise 30 minutes of class time. 
    - The goal of the presentation is to provide a brief summary of the paper and provide examples about how this issue is handled in different educational systems. All the students have read the paper prior to class and your goal is to communicate the major points effectively in a coherent and integrated matter. Your overarching goal is to show what you think is most important and interesting about the topic at hand, and you can do so by providing examples from your own experience, connecting the week’s topic to themes from prior discussions, applying the topic to “real world” issues and extending the topic to areas not covered in the readings, etc.
    - The discussion can take a variety of formats, including (a) a round table or symposium format, (b) debate of pros and cons of an issue, (c) discuss the topic with classmates focusing on context, measurement/operationalization, and theory, or any other formats you find appropriate. 
- **Short Reflection Paper (30 points)**: All the students except for the discussion leader will submit a small piece of paper that summarize what you have learned from the discussion and your reflections about the content at the end of each meeting. Ten minutes will be given to finish this paper in class.
- **Final Presentation (20 points)**: The final presentation will take place during the last few sessions of this course. This presentation roughly consists the following steps:
    -  Identify a question you would like to prove with the videos from the TIMSS video project (a public collection of videos documenting classroom processes in various parts of the world). For example, how does the teacher in Denmark explain math question differently compared to German counterparts?
    -  Find some short video clips that will demonstrate your idea. You can put together up to about 15 minutes of viewing of one or more videos from this collection. 
    -  Summarize what you have seen in these video clips, and explain your findings using the knowledge you have learned from this course.
    -  More detailed instruction will be provided as time draws closer. 


## Class Policies
It will be important to follow a few general guidelines to ensure that our lessons run smoothly and are enjoyable for everyone.  

- Class will start 15 minutes after the meeting time, please arrive on time.
- There will be no class break so we can end class before 12pm. 
- Please put away and silence all unnecessary electronic devices. However, if you would like to use a laptop to take notes, that is acceptable as long as it does not disrupt your participation or that of others in class. If you choose to bring your laptop to class you may be called on to participate more frequently. 
- This course is provided in English since I can't speak German (yet). I also encourage you using English within group activities so that I can better facilitate your learning process. But don't struggle with language if you feel more comfortable using German to communicate with your peers.
- When engaging in discussions please be respectful and relevant. Being respectful includes addressing ideas offered by classmates in a constructive manner. Being relevant requires that comments made in class relate to the material in a way that enriches our learning. Everyone should and will have the chance to contribute to discussions.
