## Course Objectives
What does the future of education entail? Does traditional pedagogy still hold true when instructional technology evolves at a rate greater than ever before? This course is intended to map the present landscape of information and communications technology (ICT) used for education, to reflect on their benefits as well as potential drawbacks, and to connect new technology with old ideas. 

Specifically, we will examine traditional learning theories from new perspectives, explore best practices for using various technologies for teaching, and apply what we have learned in your specific subject settings. We will cover topics including multi-media learning, game-based learning, embodied learning (VR/AR/XR), personalized and adaptive learning, child development and technology, and cloud-based learning.

## Competence Goal and Evaluation
By the end of this seminar, you would be expected to a) have a good overview of what digital tools are available for educators in the market; b) be able to evaluate and select digital tools for your subjects; c) explore how to keep up with the ever-changing field of information and communications technology.

Your performance will be jointly evaluated based on reflective online discussions and group-based lesson designs. There will be no quiz, exam or final papers. Please find detailed description of each assignment and grades breakdown below.

- **General Workflow**
    - We'll cover one topic every two weeks, first week being a general overview of the topic and second week includes a group presentation (see below). 
- **Online Discussion (50 points)**  
    - We'll utilize a group chatting tool (Discord) for posting your reflections on certain topic each week.
    - Each week, summarize in the discussion channel about what you have learned from the class and your reflections about the content.
    - Everyone is expected to post at least once each week, but the more the merrier! You are also encouraged to engage in discussions with other peers. I will moderate and contribute the discussion regularly. 
- **Presentation of Lesson Design (50 points)**
    - Everyone will pick one topic they are most interested in and design an learning activity, a lesson, or any unit of instruction based on this topic of choice and their subjects. 
    - You will work together with other classmates who's also interested in this topic. 
    - The presentation can take a variety of formats, including (a) regular slides presentation; (b) hands-on workshop; (c) simulation of real lesson; or any other formats you find appropriate. 
    - More detailed instruction will be posted later. 
- **Bonus: Annotate the Course Website (no points, but more fun)**
    - As you will find all the materials in our course website, I also encourage you to use online annotation tool [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) to share your thoughts about our course slides and other contents directly on the webpage.
    - Fork our course site repository to make a course site of you own!

## Class Policies
It will be important to follow a few general guidelines to ensure that our lessons run smoothly and are enjoyable for everyone.

- Class will start 15 minutes after the meeting time, please arrive on time.
- There will be no class break so we can end class before 12pm. 
- Please put away and silence all unnecessary electronic devices. However, if you would like to use a laptop to take notes, that is acceptable as long as it does not disrupt your participation or that of others in class. If you choose to bring your laptop to class you may be called on to participate more frequently. 
- This course is provided in English since I can't speak German (yet). I also encourage you using English within group activities so that I can better facilitate your learning process. But don't struggle with language if you feel more comfortable using German to communicate with your peers.
- When engaging in discussions please be respectful and relevant. Being respectful includes addressing ideas offered by classmates in a constructive manner. Being relevant requires that comments made in class relate to the material in a way that enriches our learning. Everyone should and will have the chance to contribute to discussions.
