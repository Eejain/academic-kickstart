## Course Objectives
What's the future of education looks like? As updates of teaching and learning technology accelerating faster than ever before, does the traditional pedagogy still hold truth? This course is designed to map the current terrain of educational technology and reflect on the benefits as well as the challenges they may carry. We'll discuss classic theories in new light, and examine emerging theories against old problems. Topics include and not limited to: virtuality and reality, embodied learning, eye tracking and teacher's professional vision, massive open online courses, etc.
This course is exploratary and experimental in its nature, please expect many changes in this syllabus :)

    - Each week, summarize in the discussion channel about what you have learned from the class and your reflections about the content.  
    - Everyone is suppposed to post at least once each week. You can also engage in discussions with other classmates, and I will join the discussion from time to time as well. 
- **Presentation of Lesson Design (50 points)**
    - Everyone will pick one topic they are most interested in and design an learning activity, a lesson, or any unit of instruction based on this topic of choice. 
    - You will work together with other classmates who's also interested in this topic.

## Class Policies
It will be important to follow a few general guidelines to ensure that our lessons run smoothly and are enjoyable for everyone.  

- Class will start 15 minutes after the meeting time, please arrive on time.
- There will be no class break so we can end class before 12pm. 
- Please put away and silence all unnecessary electronic devices. However, if you would like to use a laptop to take notes, that is acceptable as long as it does not disrupt your participation or that of others in class. If you choose to bring your laptop to class you may be called on to participate more frequently. 
- This course is provided in English since I can't speak German (yet). I also encourage you using English within group activities so that I can better facilitate your learning process. But don't struggle with language if you feel more comfortable using German to communicate with your peers.
- When engaging in discussions please be respectful and relevant. Being respectful includes addressing ideas offered by classmates in a constructive manner. Being relevant requires that comments made in class relate to the material in a way that enriches our learning. Everyone should and will have the chance to contribute to discussions.
