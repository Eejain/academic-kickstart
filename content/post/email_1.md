Dear all,

I welcome you back to a great new semester and thanks for signing up this seminar (Education on the Horizon: Teaching and Learning with technology). This course will explore the frontier of education technology through discussion of a diverse set of topics. The course is experimental in its nature, and therefore two (potentially) new tools will be used for both instruction and evaluation: course site and group chat channel.    

The [course site](https://edutech.netlify.com) is already up and running. You will find all the course-related materials shared through this site in the future, and meanwhile you can check out the syllabus. The group chat channel is hosted on [Discord] (https://discord.gg/e3VpXtv), you should be able to access this channel with any browsers.  

Here are two things that need your action:

1. Please check out the syllabus and the Discord channel before our next meeting, and let me know if you encounter any technical issues!

2. In preparation for the presentations, I would like you to vote for the topic you are most interested here before next [Friday](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bdOmFw7KLevjp87eB_meW_1oUtAbdOr_x0cDjChPA4/edit?usp=sharing). Please rank your level of interest for each candidate topic, and noted I might make adjustments if too many of you signing up for the same topic. And I welcome you to propose any other relevant topics, depending on our course schedule I might consider adding them as well. You can find a short description about each topic on the front page of our course site. 

Please feel free to get in touch if you have any additional questions (remember to put [edutech] in the subject line so I won’t miss it). I’m looking forward to a wonderful semester with you all!

best,

Eejain
